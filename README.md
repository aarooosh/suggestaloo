Random Test for my recommendation idea ! 
This was a great opportunity for me to use ChatGPT and get to learn the basics of firebase , js , html and some css . 
It was quite an interesing experience , because , despite not knowing javascript at all , after spending anough time with it and learning from GPT's explanations i was able to pick up a little bit , and eventually i could get a sense of what errors were happening and why .
